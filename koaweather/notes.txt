1. Unpack into folder
2. Install dependencies with 'npm install'
3. To start the server you can either run 'npm start' or 'node server.js'
4. The server is listening on port 8000
5. Make a GET request to the server root (i.e. if you're running locally "localhost:8000")
6. The weather middleware is sandwidched between two other middlewares whose sole purpose is to demonstrate the isolation of the weather middleware. 
7. Console logging will trace the call down and up. The last generator is responsible for generating html based on the location and weather data. 
8. If you try to run and access the server locally it will fail the location lookup (since the source ip is localhost)
